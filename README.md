Hello,
first of all,
if you want to download the game for fun,
download the latest version of the game (in Alpha), and vice versa,
if you want to understand the code (and even add things to the game)
I advise you to download the first version (the Bet√¢ 1.2) which is much more optimized and easy to understand.

For the key code, here they are :
-2nde : laying blocks 
-Alpha : Break block 
</>/v/^ : walking 
^ (below the directional cross) : jumping 
mode : Pause menu

And that's it, see you all the more for the next update :D !
